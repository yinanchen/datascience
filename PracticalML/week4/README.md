# Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

# Data set examination
There are 19622 rows and 160 columns in training data set.  
'classe' is label column with 5 classes: 'A','B','C','D','E', others are feature columns.  
41 feature columns' value nearly 98% are NA, so I removed these columns.
(ex: max_roll_dumbbell, min_roll_dumbbell, amplitude_pitch_dumbbell....) 
Then, remove rows contain NA values.

# Build classification model
* Step 1: load library  
```r
 library(caret)
 library(randomForest)
```
* Step 2:  Build classifier by random forest and use "3-folds" cross-validation
K is a free number. 3,5,10 are popular number.
```r
set.seed(7826) 
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 3)
model <- train(classe ~ ., data = train, method = "rf", trControl = control)
```
* Step 3: examine model performance
The error rate can help you to know the model performance.
Since K-fold cross validation were chosen, just evaluate the model through  
classical index - Accuracy : the proportion of the total number of predictions that were correct.
```r
  print(model)
```
  Resampling: Cross-Validated (3 fold) 
  Summary of sample sizes: 13080, 13082, 13082 
  Resampling results across tuning parameters:

  | mtry   |      Accuracy      |  Kappa |
  |----------|:-------------:|------:|
  | 2 |  0.9956684 | 0.9945210 |
  | 41 |    0.9998471   |   0.9998066 |
  | 81 | 0.9998471 |    0.9998066 |
  
  Accuracy is pretty good, so let's do testing.  
* Step 4: prediction
predict the testing set by built model.
```R
  predict(model, test)
 ```
